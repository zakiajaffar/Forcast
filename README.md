# Forcast
You can visit the website here https://zakiajaffar.github.io/Forcast/
### Optional (do as many as you like)

* The application now only reports the current weather. It should probably report the forecast e.g. a few hours from now. (tip: [openweathermap api](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5))

### Mandatory

* Get yourself an API key to make queries in the [openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/).

* Either run the app locally (using `npm i && npm start`) or move to the next step.
